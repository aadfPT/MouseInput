# MouseInputForInputMapper
Code for the plugin, that can also be forked to create custom plugins for other controllers



It implements multiple mice and will support supressing them in the future

To use download inputMapper 2 from https://inputmapper.com, install and from within the applications install this plugin.

You'll also need the profiles plugin to save the mappings, the mapping plugin, and the scarlet 360 plugin (this emulates the xbox360 controller).
